# Most expensive football player transfers of all time
This Python script scrapes info about the most expensive football transfers in history.
The script collects key info like player name, old club info, new club info, transfer fee etc. and then sorts the records in order of most expensive transfer to least expensive before saving it to a csv file.
The script also scrapes all of the player images present on the page and stores them in a separate folder (named 'player_images' by default). Each image is named after the player.
The data already scraped can be viewed in this directory.

Note: Currently, the website returns top 250 transfers but this might change in the future.
