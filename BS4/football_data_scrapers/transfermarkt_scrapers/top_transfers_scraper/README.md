# Most Expensive Football Player Transfers of a Season
This Python script scrapes info about the most expensive football transfers in a given season.
The script collects key info like player name, old club info, new club info, transfer fee etc. and then saves it to a csv file.
The script also scrapes all of the player images present on the page and stores them in a separate folder (named 'player_images' by default). Each image is named after the player.
The data already scraped can be viewed in this directory.
Each season's data is stored in a different directory named after the year (e.g. see the 1978 directory of this repo) by default.
